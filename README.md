# Potentiostat Shield for Arduino Uno
The is project is a piece of software to run a Potentiostat shield on a Arduino Uno.


## Background
A potentiostat/galvanostat is a device used to control electrochemical experiments. It can control either voltage or current between 2 or 3 electrod. For more infomration see the following links.

## The Potentiostat Shield - DIY solder
This potentisotat shield was developed in order to used as few and easy to solder(DIP package) components as possible in order to turn an arduino UNO into a potentiostat/galvanostat. 
The potentiostat has different has a cell switch and 4 different current ranges. For this, 3 digital channels are used. The control signal is generated by a SPI DAC
